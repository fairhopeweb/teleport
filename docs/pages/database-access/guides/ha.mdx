# Database Access High Availability

You can deploy Database Access in a highly available configuration in a couple
of common ways: separate replicas and combined replicas. Both of those revolve
around pointing multiple Database Services to the same database instance.

## Separate Replicas

With separate replicas, each Database Service agent proxying the database
assigns it a different name. This allows you to explicitly pick the agent
you want to connect to the database over.

For example, you may have two Database Services deployed in different
availability zones providing access to the same PostgreSQL database:

```yaml
# Database service agent #1.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  # Note the name is different than agent #2 but URI is the same.
  - name: "postgres-us-east-1a"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

```yaml
# Database service agent #2.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  # Note the name is different than agent #1 but URI is the same.
  - name: "postgres-us-east-1b"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

With this configuration, both services will appear as two separate entries in
`tsh db ls` output and you will have to pick one explicitly when connecting:

```bash
$ tsh db ls
Name
-------------------
postgres-us-east-1a
postgres-us-east-1b

$ tsh db login postgres-us-east-1a
$ tsh db connect postgres-us-east-1a
```

This approach is useful when you want to have control over which replica
you're using to connect.

## Combined Replicas

A more common approach is to assign the same `name` to each Database Service
proxying the database.

Configuration for both agents in our example would be identical in this case:

```yaml
# Same config for both agents.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  - name: "postgres"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

With this configuration, you will see only a single entry for the database in
`tsh db ls`:

```bash
$ tsh db ls
Name
--------
postgres

$ tsh db login postgres
$ tsh db connect postgres
```

When connecting, Teleport will randomly pick the service to connect through to
provide some load balancing. If the selected agent is down (e.g. in case of AZ
outage), Teleport will try to connect via other agents.
