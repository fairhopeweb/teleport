Teleport uses mutual TLS authentication with self-hosted databases. As such,
they must be configured with Teleport's certificate authority to be able to
validate client certificates and a certificate/key pair that Teleport can
validate.

To create these secrets, use `tctl auth sign` command. It can be run either
[locally](../../architecture/overview.mdx#tctl) on the auth server, or from the
client machine after logging in with `tsh login` (for example, when using
[Teleport Cloud](../../cloud/introduction.mdx)).

In the latter case, user must be allowed to impersonate the system role `Db` in
order to be able to generate the database certificate, by having the following
allow rule in their role:

```yaml
allow:
  impersonate:
    users: ["Db"]
    roles: ["Db"]
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Certificate Rotation">
  Teleport signs database certificates with the host authority. As such,
  when performing [host certificates rotation](../../admin-guide.mdx#certificate-rotation),
  the database certificates must be updated as well.
</Admonition>
